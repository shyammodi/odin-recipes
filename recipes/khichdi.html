    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Khichdi, a wholesome and comforting dish, is a classic Indian one-pot meal made with a combination of rice and lentils. This simple and nutritious dish is often considered easy on the stomach and is a go-to comfort food. To prepare Khichdi, rice and lentils are cooked together with aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric until they form a soft and porridge-like consistency. The dish can be customized with additional vegetables, and it is commonly served with a dollop of ghee or yogurt for added richness. Khichdi is not only delicious but also a nourishing option for a quick and satisfying meal.
